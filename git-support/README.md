# Git Support

The hooks directory contains some useful git hooks that you can install,
and if you are adventurous, you can use the install-hooks.sh script to do so.

NOTE: The install-hooks.sh "code" is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules. 
Use with caution. PRs to improve any and all of this are gleefully considered.
