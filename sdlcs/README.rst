SDLC Documentation
==================

This is where we put all the Software Development Life Cycle and related documentation.
This is not packageable code, it is here for reference and linking.

The documents in this directory apply:

* across all of the QE-Tools repo packages
* as base-lines/starting points for individual QE Teams for their corresponding documentation.

The goal is that QE, as much as possible, share a common set of SDLC processes and documents,
with any deletions, additions, or modifications being relatively minor:
"We follow the QE standard, except our lines are a maximum of 70 characters long."
