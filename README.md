# QE-Tools
To hold tools and configurations used by the AF and ARIC QE Teams


* tags.md - describes the tagging we use for controlling our Gherkin tests and for generating test coverage reports.
* reporting.md - describes how the pieces fit together and what conventions we use on top of the tooling.
* stats.py - generate a Gherkin-based test coverage report.
* checkboxestiming.py - a quick and dirty script that read the JSON of an executed CheckBoxes process and look-for/report-on slow APIs.
* test_tags.py - helper for reading the tags.md file in Python.
* tox.ini - initial stab at tox based testing.
